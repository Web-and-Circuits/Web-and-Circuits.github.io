The provided image serves as a direct visual reference for the desired design, which is crucial for accurately implementing the requested architecture diagram.

Based on this reference and the requirements of the task, here are my reasoning steps:
- The original diagram shows a "hub-and-spoke" pattern with the API in the center and external components radiating outward.
- This indicates that I should create a central point (the API) from which all other elements will be organized.
- I will use this as a guide to arrange the new layout, ensuring it's clear and consistent with the reference image.
