{"reasoning": "Now that I've set up the initial layout, I'll add arrows to represent data flows between components in a logical sequence. The key here is to ensure the diagram reflects real-world system behavior while maintaining clarity and correctness. For this architecture with user authentication, the flow should follow: User → Frontend → API (authentication check) → Database (read/write operations) → File Storage (for file uploads). I'll make sure that each arrow accurately represents a data path, starting from user input through to storage. The most important connections are those between components where data actually flows—such as the frontend calling the API for authentication and authorization checks, then the API querying the database, storing files, and handling responses.\n\nI’ll ensure that arrows are drawn with consistent directionality and proper spacing so they don’t clutter the diagram but still clearly show the flow. The visual cues will help developers understand how data moves through the system, making it easier to spot potential bottlenecks or performance issues. I'll use arrow types like 'arrow' for clarity and set them appropriately using relative coordinates from each component’s position.\n\nI’ll also ensure all elements are labeled with descriptive names so they're easy to identify in a real-world context.", "diagram": {"type":"excalidraw","version":2,"source":"agent","elements":[],"appState":{"viewBackgroundColor":"#ffffff"}}}
