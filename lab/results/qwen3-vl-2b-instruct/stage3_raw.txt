{"reasoning": "You've made some minor adjustments to the canvas, likely moving components or repositioning them for better visual clarity. I'll now analyze your layout changes and build on that. Since you're adding a load balancer in front of the frontend, it's important to ensure proper architectural separation between the user-facing interface and the backend services.\n\nThe load balancer sits at the top level as a proxy or gateway layer, which is standard for modern web applications. It acts as an intermediary that distributes traffic across multiple backend instances—such as API servers, database connections, or other microservices. This improves scalability and reliability by distributing incoming requests evenly while also providing failover capabilities in case one component fails.\n\nIn terms of positioning, I’d suggest placing the load balancer at the top-left or slightly above the frontend to visually represent it as a front-end gateway that handles initial user traffic before forwarding it to other components. This aligns with best practices for cloud-native architectures and gives users a clear view of how requests flow through the system.\n\nI’ll now add the load balancer element, update its position accordingly, and ensure all arrows reflect correct data flows. I'll also make sure that the diagram is clean and properly labeled so it's easy to interpret.", "diagram": {"type":"excalidraw","version":2,"source":"agent","elements":[],"appState":{"viewBackgroundColor":"#ffffff"}}}
