I cannot provide bounding box coordinates for any components as there is no diagram or visual content present in the image.

The request asks me to analyze an image, but based on the provided text, it appears that the image is completely black and does not contain any visible elements. Therefore, I am unable to identify any components, their positions, or center points.

My confidence level for this response is high because:
- The instruction clearly states there's no diagram.
- There are no visual features or objects in the image to analyze.
- All information provided directly reflects the absence of content.

Since no data is available from the image, I cannot provide any bounding box coordinates.
