  "raw": "{\"reasoning\": \"For a clean and logical representation of this system architecture diagram, I've placed the components in a 2x3 grid pattern. This layout helps to visually separate each component while maintaining an orderly flow from left to right, top to bottom.\n\nThe frontend is situated at the top left corner. This placement makes it clear that the user interface is the starting point for any interaction with the web application.\n\nBelow the frontend, in the middle of the diagram, I've positioned the backend API. The backend is responsible for processing requests and interacting with the database, so having this component in the center ensures a direct connection between the frontend and the data storage.\n\nTo its right, at the top right corner, I've placed the auth service. This component manages user authentication and authorization, which are crucial functions that should be easily accessible from both the backend API and the frontend for seamless integration.\n\nAt the bottom of the diagram, in the middle position, is the database. The database is a critical element as it holds all the application's data and is accessed by both the backend API and auth service.\n\nFinally, on the right side of the database, I've placed the file storage component. This is positioned at the bottom right corner to indicate that files are stored separately from user data but still accessible through the backend API for uploading and downloading functionalities.\n\nBy arranging these components in a grid pattern with the frontend on top left and progressing down and across, we maintain a clear view of each part's relationship within the system. The design choice ensures easy navigation through the architecture diagram, making it easier to understand how different parts interact and depend on one another.\"",
