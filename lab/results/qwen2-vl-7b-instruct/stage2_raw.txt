{"reasoning": "Following the user's interaction with the web application, we start at the frontend where the user initiates a request to access the system. The arrow pointing from the frontend to the backend API indicates this initial step.

The next significant connection is between the API and the auth service. As the user requests data or functionality, it's essential that authentication checks are performed to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information.

From there, the arrow from the auth service to the database signifies the flow of checking for user permissions within the backend. This ensures that only authenticated users receive their requested data or services.

The next arrow points from the database to the API, indicating that the API queries the database on behalf of the user's request. This connection is crucial as it represents the backend processing the request and fetching the necessary information.

Finally, the last arrow in our diagram shows the API storing files, which is important for any application that involves file management or uploading/download functionality.

By drawing these arrows, we've created a clear visual representation of how data flows from one component to another when a user interacts with the system. The connections between the auth service and database, as well as between the API and database, are critical because they ensure security and proper processing of user requests."
