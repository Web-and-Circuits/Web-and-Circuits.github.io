{"reasoning": "The initial layout of our diagram was straightforward, but adding arrows helps to clarify how data flows through each component. By starting with the frontend request and then following the path through authentication, database querying, file storage, and back to the frontend for response, we create a clear visual narrative of user interaction.

The most critical connections are those between the auth service and database, as well as between the API and both the auth service and database. These arrows highlight the essential interactions required to maintain security and ensure proper data retrieval or file handling.

These connections matter because they represent the core functionality of maintaining secure access and processing requests efficiently. Without these steps, the system would be vulnerable to unauthorized access and could fail to meet user expectations for performance and security."}
