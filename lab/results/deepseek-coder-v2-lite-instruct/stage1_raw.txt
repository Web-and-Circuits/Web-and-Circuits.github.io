 {"reasoning": "To create an effective system architecture diagram for a modern web application with user authentication, I decided to position the components in a way that reflects typical interactions and dependencies between services. The frontend handles user interfaces and interactions, so it should be positioned closer to the users. The backend API serves as the interface between the frontend and other internal services, handling data processing and business logic. Placing the backend API centrally allows for easy communication with both the frontend and database/auth service. The database stores application data, which is crucial but not directly accessible by external users or systems, so it's placed behind the backend API. Lastly, the auth service manages user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific parts of the system. Placing this service separately from the main backend ensures security and scalability. Overall, this layout promotes clarity in understanding how information flows within the application.", "diagram": {"type":"excalidraw","version":2,"source":"agent","elements":[{"type":"rectangle","x":100,"y":50,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"#ffffff","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"id":"UserAuthenticationDiagram_1","seed":365421297,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"name":"frontend"},{"type":"rectangle","x":400,"y":50,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#e8590c","backgroundColor":"#ffffff","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"id":"UserAuthenticationDiagram_2","seed":476326877,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"name":"backend API"},{"type":"rectangle","x":250,"y":170,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#9c36b5","backgroundColor":"#ffffff","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"id":"UserAuthenticationDiagram_3","seed":476326877,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"name":"database"},{"type":"rectangle","x":250,"y":290,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#2f9e44","backgroundColor":"#ffffff","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"id":"UserAuthenticationDiagram_4","seed":476326877,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"name":"auth service"},{"type":"rectangle","x":250,"y":410,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#e03131","backgroundColor":"#ffffff","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"id":"UserAuthenticationDiagram_5","seed":476326877,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"name":"file storage"}, {"type":"arrow","x":200,"y":90,"width":0,"height":0,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"transparent","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":4,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"points":[[0,0],[0,-360]],"version":1,"isDeleted":false},{"type":"arrow","x":450,"y":90,"width":0,"height":0,"strokeColor":"#e8590c","backgroundColor":"transparent","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":4,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"points":[[0,0],[0,-360]],"version":1,"isDeleted":false},{"type":"arrow","x":250,"y":210,"width":0,"height":0,"strokeColor":"#9c36b5","backgroundColor":"transparent","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":4,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"points":[[0,0],[0,-120]],"version":1,"isDeleted":false},{"type":"arrow","x":250,"y":330,"width":0,"height":0,"strokeColor":"#2f9e44","backgroundColor":"transparent","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":4,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"points":[[0,0],[0,-120]],"version":1,"isDeleted":false},{"type":"arrow","x":250,"y":450,"width":0,"height":0,"strokeColor":"#e03131","backgroundColor":"transparent","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":4,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"points":[[0,0],[0,-120]],"version":1,"isDeleted":false}],"appState":{"viewBackgroundColor":"#ffffff"}}}
