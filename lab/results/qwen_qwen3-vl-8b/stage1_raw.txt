{"reasoning": "I’m designing a system architecture diagram for a modern web application with user authentication. The layout follows a logical flow from user interaction to data persistence. I’ve placed the frontend at the top-left as it’s the entry point for users. The backend API sits directly below it to handle requests from the frontend. The auth service is positioned between the frontend and backend API because it’s critical for validating user sessions before any backend operations. The database is placed at the bottom-center to represent the persistent storage layer. File storage is positioned to the right of the backend API, since it’s typically accessed via the backend for storing assets like images or documents. This layout creates a clear vertical hierarchy (frontend → backend → data) and horizontal separation for specialized services like auth and storage. I’ve also left space between components for readability and future expansion.", "diagram": {"type":"excalidraw","version":2,"source":"agent","elements":[{"type":"rectangle","id":"1","x":100,"y":100,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"#e8590c","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":12345,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Frontend","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"2","x":100,"y":200,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"#2f9e44","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":12346,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Backend API","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"3","x":100,"y":300,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"#9c36b5","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":12347,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Database","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"4","x":350,"y":200,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"#e03131","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":12348,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Auth Service","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"5","x":350,"y":100,"width":200,"height":80,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"#e03131","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":12349,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"File Storage","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"}],"appState":{"viewBackgroundColor":"#ffffff"}}}
