Here is a precise description of everything visible in the image:

---

**1. Number of Components:**
There are **5** distinct rectangular components in the diagram.

---

**2. Component Names and Colors:**

- **Frontend** → Orange rectangle with white text.
- **Backend API** → Green rectangle with white text.
- **Database** → Purple rectangle with white text.
- **File Storage** → Red rectangle with white text.
- **Auth Service** → Red rectangle with white text.

---

**3. Layout Pattern:**

The components are arranged in a **two-column, three-row grid**, but not perfectly aligned due to the vertical positioning of the elements.

- **Left Column (Vertical Stack):**
  - Top: Frontend (orange)
  - Middle: Backend API (green)
  - Bottom: Database (purple)

- **Right Column (Vertical Stack):**
  - Top: File Storage (red)
  - Bottom: Auth Service (red)

The layout is **not symmetrical** — the left column has three components stacked vertically, while the right column has two components stacked vertically, with space below Auth Service.

**4. Connections/Arrows:**

There are **five** bidirectional arrows (double-headed) connecting components:

- **Frontend ↔ Backend API** — Vertical arrow between orange and green.
- **Backend API ↔ Database** — Vertical arrow between green and purple.
- **Frontend ↔ File Storage** — Diagonal arrow from orange to red (top-right).
- **File Storage ↔ Auth Service** — Vertical arrow between red (top) and red (bottom).
- **Auth Service ↔ Database** — Diagonal arrow from red (bottom) to purple (left).

Note: The arrows are **blue** and **bidirectional**, meaning they indicate two-way communication between the connected components.

**5. Title:**

There is **no title** visible anywhere in the image.

✅ All elements are clearly readable, and the diagram is well-defined with distinct colors, labels, and connections.
