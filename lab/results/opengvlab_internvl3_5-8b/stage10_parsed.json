  "raw": "The visual reference of the Hub-and-Spoke Architecture Pattern provided insight into organizing system components around a central hub, which is the API Gateway in this case. Here's how I applied these principles to redesign our architecture:\n\n1. **Central Hub**: The API Gateway became the central node, representing the core communication point for all services.\n\n2. **Circular Arrangement**: Components were rearranged in a circular fashion around the API Gateway, ensuring each service is equidistant from the hub. This promotes balanced interaction and access.\n\n3. **Connectivity Lines**: Each component was connected directly to the API Gateway with lines radiating outward, emphasizing direct communication pathways.\n\n4. **Component Placement**:\n   - **CDN**, **Cache**, **Database**, **Auth**, **File Store** were positioned around the API Gateway.\n   - The layout ensures that each service can efficiently communicate with the central hub without unnecessary complexity.\n\nThis redesign enhances clarity and efficiency by visually representing direct interactions between services through a centralized API Gateway.",
