  "raw": "The visual reference significantly influenced the redesign by establishing a clear, radial hub-and-spoke layout where the **API Gateway** is the central hub and all other components are arranged symmetrically around it. This pattern emphasizes centralized control and routing, which aligns with the reference diagram\u2019s structure.\n\nHere\u2019s how the reference influenced my new layout decisions:\n\n1.  **Central Hub Placement**: The reference image explicitly positions the API Gateway at the center. I adopted this by making the API Gateway the focal point of the diagram, ensuring it is visually dominant and equidistant from all other components.\n\n2.  **Radial Arrangement**: The reference uses a circular, radial layout. I mirrored this by placing all components (Frontend, CDN, Auth, File Store, Cache, Database) at equal distances from the center, arranged in a circular fashion. This creates visual balance and clearly conveys that each component connects directly to the central API Gateway.\n\n3.  **Connection Style**: The reference uses distinct, dashed lines to show connections from the hub to each spoke. I replicated this by using different colored dashed lines to connect each component to the central API Gateway, visually reinforcing the hub-and-spoke relationship.\n\n4.  **Symmetry and Clarity**: The radial layout in the reference promotes symmetry and clarity. I used this to ensure the diagram is easy to read and understand, with each component clearly associated with the central hub.\n\nIn summary, the reference image provided a clear visual model for implementing a hub-and-spoke architecture. It guided me to prioritize the central API Gateway, arrange components radially, and use distinct visual cues to emphasize the hub-and-spoke relationships. The result is a diagram that accurately reflects the intended architecture and is visually consistent with the reference.",
