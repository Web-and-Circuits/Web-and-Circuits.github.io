Actually, there are no differences between the two versions you provided.

Both images are identical. They show the same five components:
- Frontend (Browser)
- Backend API
- Auth Service
- Database
- File Storage

They also have the same connections:
- From Frontend to Backend API
- From Backend API to Auth Service
- From Backend API to Database
- From Backend API to File Storage

The colors of the components and the arrows are also identical.

Therefore, I cannot answer your questions about what was added, moved, or changed, because there are no changes to compare. The two versions are exactly the same.

The version you provided is the final version, and it is also the only version available for comparison. Since there are no changes, it is equally good as the "early version" — which doesn't exist in this context.
