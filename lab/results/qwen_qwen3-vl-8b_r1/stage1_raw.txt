{"reasoning": "I’m designing a system architecture diagram for a modern web application with user authentication. The layout follows a logical flow from user interaction to data persistence and authentication. The frontend (browser) is placed at the top as the entry point for users. The backend API sits directly below it to handle requests from the frontend, making it the central hub. The database is positioned to the right of the backend API, since it’s where persistent data resides — and in most architectures, it’s accessed by the backend. The auth service is placed adjacent to the backend API, since authentication logic is typically tightly coupled with the API layer (e.g., validating tokens or managing sessions). File storage is also placed to the right of the backend API, because it’s often used for media or static assets and accessed by the backend. I’ve used horizontal alignment to group related components and vertical stacking to show flow of data and requests from top to bottom. This layout is intuitive and scalable — it allows for easy addition of new services or layers later.", "diagram": {"type":"excalidraw","version":2,"source":"agent","elements":[{"type":"rectangle","id":"frontend","x":100,"y":100,"width":200,"height":150,"strokeColor":"#1971c2","backgroundColor":"#e0f2fe","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":12345,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Frontend (Browser)","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"backend-api","x":100,"y":260,"width":200,"height":150,"strokeColor":"#2f9e44","backgroundColor":"#e8f5e9","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":67890,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Backend API","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"database","x":350,"y":260,"width":200,"height":150,"strokeColor":"#e8590c","backgroundColor":"#ffe0e0","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":54321,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Database","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"auth-service","x":100,"y":420,"width":200,"height":150,"strokeColor":"#9c36b5","backgroundColor":"#f3e5f5","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":98765,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"Auth Service","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"},{"type":"rectangle","id":"file-storage","x":350,"y":420,"width":200,"height":150,"strokeColor":"#e03131","backgroundColor":"#ffebee","fillStyle":"solid","strokeWidth":2,"roughness":1,"opacity":100,"angle":0,"seed":11223,"version":1,"isDeleted":false,"text":"File Storage","fontSize":16,"fontFamily":1,"textAlign":"center"}],"appState":{"viewBackgroundColor":"#ffffff"}}}
